# Wordpress WebApp Boilerplate

Experimental - Laravel like Wordpress webapp boilerplate

Designed to allow for you to build out a single app within wordpress.

\*Whilst this uses Wordpress's plugin architecture it is not meant to be used to create general puropse plugins.

Inspired by this blog post (https://roots.io/routing-wp-requests/) and a desire to find a simple solution that can be easily enhanced.
