# Wordpress WebApp Boilerplate (Experimental)

Laravel like Wordpress WebApp boilerplate

Designed to allow for you to build out a single app within Wordpress.

_Whilst this uses Wordpress's plugin architecture it is not meant to be used to create general puropse plugins._

Inspired Laravel and routing technique by this blog post (https://roots.io/routing-wp-requests/) and motivated by a desire to find a simple solution that can be easily enhanced.
